Source code is private. Available upon request.

Game project designed in Luau — grid-based, tick-driven combat with monsters, hazards, and teams.

## Combat

Combat is documented at **[COMBAT.md](COMBAT.md)**. That overview describes:

- Tick-based battle loop and action queue
- Grid, monsters, hazards, obstacles
- Stats (HP, action gauge, energy gauge, attack/defense multipliers)
- Auto vs active actions
- Team Implementations, Reserve Slots, and Swapping

No implementation or source is included as it is a design showcase/summary.
