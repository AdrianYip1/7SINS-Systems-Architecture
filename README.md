Roblox project — grid-based, tick-driven combat with monsters, hazards, and teams.

## Combat

Combat is documented at **[docs/COMBAT.md](docs/COMBAT.md)**. That overview describes:

- Tick-based battle loop and action queue
- Grid, monsters, hazards, obstacles
- Stats (HP, action gauge, energy gauge, attack/defense multipliers)
- Auto vs active actions (e.g. PhysAttack, ElmtAttack, Heal, Guard, Focus)
- Teams, reserve, and swapping

No implementation or source is included as it is a design showcase/summary.
